	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        Efficient algorithms are those with lower time complexity, enabling faster execution especially on large data sets.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        It is often expressed in terms of O(n), indicating that the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
